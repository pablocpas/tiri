### Overview

Key bindings are declared in the `binds {}` section of the config.

> [!NOTE]
> This is one of the few sections that *does not* get automatically filled with defaults if you omit it, so make sure to copy it from the default config.

Each bind is a hotkey followed by one action enclosed in curly brackets.
For example:

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Left { focus-container-left; }
    Super+Alt+L { spawn "swaylock"; }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Some actions have two spellings, one naming a *column* and one naming a *container*. Tiri has
> no columns — it tiles into a tree — so the `container` spelling is the documented one, and the
> `column` one is kept as an alias so that configs carried over from niri keep working. Where
> both exist they are the same action; there is no reason to prefer the older name in a new
> config.

> [!NOTE]
> Many action names still use `column` for compatibility with niri and the IPC surface.
> In current tiri, those actions target the top-level tiling subtree or container on a workspace rather than a special internal "column" type.

The hotkey consists of modifiers separated by `+` signs, followed by an XKB key name in the end.

Valid modifiers are:

- `Ctrl` or `Control`;
- `Shift`;
- `Alt`;
- `Super` or `Win`;
- `ISO_Level3_Shift` or `Mod5`—this is the AltGr key on certain layouts;
- `ISO_Level5_Shift`: can be used with an xkb lv5 option like `lv5:caps_switch`;
- `Mod`.

`Mod` is a special modifier that is equal to `Super` when running tiri on a TTY, and to `Alt` when running tiri as a nested winit window.
This way, you can test tiri in a window without causing too many conflicts with the host compositor's key bindings.
For this reason, most of the default keys use the `Mod` modifier.

<sup>Upstream niri: 25.05</sup> You can customize the `Mod` key [in the `input` section of the config](./Configuration:-Input.md#mod-key-mod-key-nested).

> [!TIP]
> To find an XKB name for a particular key, you may use a program like [`wev`](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/wev).
>
> Open it from a terminal and press the key that you want to detect.
> In the terminal, you will see output like this:
>
> ```
> [14:     wl_keyboard] key: serial: 757775; time: 44940343; key: 113; state: 1 (pressed)
>                       sym: Left         (65361), utf8: ''
> [14:     wl_keyboard] key: serial: 757776; time: 44940432; key: 113; state: 0 (released)
>                       sym: Left         (65361), utf8: ''
> [14:     wl_keyboard] key: serial: 757777; time: 44940753; key: 114; state: 1 (pressed)
>                       sym: Right        (65363), utf8: ''
> [14:     wl_keyboard] key: serial: 757778; time: 44940846; key: 114; state: 0 (released)
>                       sym: Right        (65363), utf8: ''
> ```
>
> Here, look at `sym: Left` and `sym: Right`: these are the key names.
> In this example, the left and the right arrow keys were pressed.
>
> Keep in mind that binding shifted keys requires spelling out Shift and the unshifted version of the key, according to your XKB layout.
> For example, on the US QWERTY layout, <kbd>&lt;</kbd> is on <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>, so to bind it, you spell out something like `Mod+Shift+Comma`.
>
> As another example, if you've configured the French [BÉPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%89PO) XKB layout, your <kbd>&lt;</kbd> is on <kbd>AltGr</kbd> + <kbd>«</kbd>.
> <kbd>AltGr</kbd> is `ISO_Level3_Shift`, or equivalently `Mod5`, so to bind it, you spell out something like `Mod+Mod5+guillemotleft`.
>
> When resolving latin keys, tiri will search for the *first* configured XKB layout that has the latin key.
> So for example with US QWERTY and RU layouts configured, US QWERTY will be used for latin binds.

<sup>Upstream niri: 0.1.8</sup> Binds will repeat by default (i.e. holding down a bind will make it trigger repeatedly).
You can disable that for specific binds with `repeat=false`:

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Return repeat=false { spawn "alacritty"; }
}
```

Binds can also have a cooldown, which will rate-limit the bind and prevent it from repeatedly triggering too quickly.

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Return cooldown-ms=500 { spawn "alacritty"; }
}
```

This is mostly useful for binds that would otherwise trigger too quickly.

### Scroll Bindings

Scroll bindings are currently disabled in tiri.

You can bind mouse wheel scroll ticks using the following syntax.
These binds will change direction based on the `natural-scroll` setting.

```text
binds {
    Mod+WheelScrollDown cooldown-ms=150 { focus-workspace-down; }
    Mod+WheelScrollUp   cooldown-ms=150 { focus-workspace-up; }
    Mod+WheelScrollRight                { focus-container-right; }
    Mod+WheelScrollLeft                 { focus-container-left; }
}
```

Similarly, you can bind touchpad scroll "ticks".
Touchpad scrolling is continuous, so for these binds it is split into discrete intervals based on distance travelled.

These binds are also affected by touchpad's `natural-scroll`, so these example binds are "inverted", since tiri has `natural-scroll` enabled for touchpads by default.

```text
binds {
    Mod+TouchpadScrollDown { spawn "wpctl" "set-volume" "@DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@" "0.02+"; }
    Mod+TouchpadScrollUp   { spawn "wpctl" "set-volume" "@DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@" "0.02-"; }
}
```

Both mouse wheel and touchpad scroll binds will prevent applications from receiving any scroll events when their modifiers are held down.
For example, if you have a `Mod+WheelScrollDown` bind, then while holding `Mod`, all mouse wheel scrolling will be consumed by tiri.

### Mouse Click Bindings

<sup>Upstream niri: 25.01</sup>

You can bind mouse clicks using the following syntax.

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+MouseLeft    { close-window; }
    Mod+MouseRight   { close-window; }
    Mod+MouseMiddle  { close-window; }
    Mod+MouseForward { close-window; }
    Mod+MouseBack    { close-window; }
}
```

Mouse clicks operate on the window that was focused at the time of the click, not the window you're clicking.

Note that binding `Mod+MouseLeft` or `Mod+MouseRight` will override the corresponding gesture (moving or resizing the window).

### Custom Hotkey Overlay Titles

<sup>Upstream niri: 25.02</sup>

The hotkey overlay (the Important Hotkeys dialog) shows a hardcoded list of binds.
You can customize this list using the `hotkey-overlay-title` property.

To add a bind to the hotkey overlay, set the property to the title that you want to show:
```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Shift+S hotkey-overlay-title="Toggle Dark/Light Style" { spawn "some-script.sh"; }
}
```

Binds with custom titles are listed after the hardcoded binds and before non-customized Spawn binds.

To remove a hardcoded bind from the hotkey overlay, set the property to null:
```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Q hotkey-overlay-title=null { close-window; }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> When multiple key combinations are bound to the same action:
> - If any of the binds has a custom hotkey overlay title, tiri will show that bind.
> - Otherwise, if any of the binds has a null title, tiri will hide the bind.
> - Otherwise, tiri will show the first key combination.

Custom titles support [Pango markup](https://docs.gtk.org/Pango/pango_markup.html):

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Shift+S hotkey-overlay-title="<b>Toggle</b> <span foreground='red'>Dark</span>/Light Style" { spawn "some-script.sh"; }
}
```

### Actions

Every action that you can bind is also available for programmatic invocation via `tiri msg action`.
Run `tiri msg action` to get a full list of actions along with their short descriptions.

Here are a few actions that benefit from more explanation.

#### Common i3-style layout actions

These actions are especially relevant in tiri because the internal layout is a container tree rather than a pure scrolling-column model.

- `focus-parent`: selects the parent container of the focused node.
- `focus-child`: moves focus from the selected container back down to a child.
- `split-horizontal`: make the focused container split horizontally.
- `split-vertical`: make the focused container split vertically.
- `toggle-split-layout`: switch the current split container between horizontal and vertical.
- `set-layout-tabbed`: convert the selected container to tabbed layout.
- `set-layout-stacked`: convert the selected container to stacked layout.
- `toggle-window-floating`: toggle the focused window between floating and tiling.
- `switch-focus-between-floating-and-tiling`: switch focus between the floating layer and the tiling tree.
- `toggle-autotile`: turn [`autotile`](./Configuration:-Layout.md#autotile) on or off, so new windows split what they land beside instead of joining a row.

Example:

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+A { focus-parent; }
    Mod+B { split-horizontal; }
    Mod+V { split-vertical; }
    Mod+W { set-layout-tabbed; }
    Mod+S { set-layout-stacked; }
    Mod+E { toggle-split-layout; }
    Mod+Shift+A { toggle-autotile; }
    Mod+Shift+Space { toggle-window-floating; }
    Mod+Space { switch-focus-between-floating-and-tiling; }
}
```

#### Scratchpad actions

Tiri supports i3-style scratchpad behavior.

- `move-window-to-scratchpad`: send the focused window to the scratchpad.
- `scratchpad-show`: show the scratchpad window, or hide it again if it is already visible.

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Shift+Minus { move-window-to-scratchpad; }
    Mod+Minus { scratchpad-show; }
}
```

#### Mark actions

Marks let you tag windows with arbitrary names.
This is mainly useful for IPC-driven workflows and scripting.

- `mark "name"`: replace the focused window's marks with `name`.
- `mark-add "name"`: add a mark without removing existing marks.
- `mark-toggle "name"`: toggle the mark on the focused window.
- `mark-replace "name"`: explicit spelling of the default replace behavior.
- `unmark "name"`: remove that mark everywhere.
- `unmark`: remove all marks from the focused window.

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Shift+1 { mark "todo"; }
    Mod+Shift+2 { mark-add "review"; }
    Mod+Shift+3 { mark-toggle "pinned"; }
    Mod+Shift+0 { unmark; }
}
```

#### Hotkey overlay

`show-hotkey-overlay` opens the built-in "Important Hotkeys" dialog.
The default config binds it to <kbd>Mod</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>/</kbd>.

#### `spawn`

Run a program.

`spawn` accepts a path to the program binary as the first argument, followed by arguments to the program.
For example:

```kdl
binds {
    // Run alacritty.
    Mod+Return { spawn "alacritty"; }

    // Run `wpctl set-volume @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@ 0.1+`.
    XF86AudioRaiseVolume { spawn "wpctl" "set-volume" "@DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@" "0.1+"; }
}
```

> [!TIP]
>
> <sup>Upstream niri: 0.1.5</sup>
>
> Spawn bindings have a special `allow-when-locked=true` property that makes them work even while the session is locked:
>
> ```kdl
> binds {
>     // This mute bind will work even when the session is locked.
>     XF86AudioMute allow-when-locked=true { spawn "wpctl" "set-mute" "@DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@" "toggle"; }
> }
> ```

For `spawn`, tiri *does not* use a shell to run commands, which means that you need to manually separate arguments.
See [`spawn-sh`](#spawn-sh) below for an action that uses a shell.

```kdl
binds {
    // Correct: every argument is in its own quotes.
    Mod+Return { spawn "alacritty" "-e" "/usr/bin/fish"; }

    // Wrong: will interpret the whole `alacritty -e /usr/bin/fish` string as the binary path.
    Mod+D { spawn "alacritty -e /usr/bin/fish"; }

    // Wrong: will pass `-e /usr/bin/fish` as one argument, which alacritty won't understand.
    Mod+Q { spawn "alacritty" "-e /usr/bin/fish"; }
}
```

This also means that you cannot expand environment variables or `~`.
If you need this, you can run the command through a shell manually.

```kdl
binds {
    // Wrong: no shell expansion here. These strings will be passed literally to the program.
    Mod+Return { spawn "grim" "-o" "$MAIN_OUTPUT" "~/screenshot.png"; }

    // Correct: run this through a shell manually so that it can expand the arguments.
    // Note that the entire command is passed as a SINGLE argument,
    // because shell will do its own argument splitting by whitespace.
    Mod+D { spawn "sh" "-c" "grim -o $MAIN_OUTPUT ~/screenshot.png"; }

    // You can also use a shell to run multiple commands,
    // use pipes, process substitution, and so on.
    Mod+Q { spawn "sh" "-c" "notify-send clipboard \"$(wl-paste)\""; }
}
```

As a special case, tiri will expand `~` to the home directory *only* at the beginning of the program name.

```kdl
binds {
    // This will work: one ~ at the very beginning.
    Mod+Return { spawn "~/scripts/do-something.sh"; }
}
```

#### `spawn-sh`

<sup>Upstream niri: 25.08</sup>

Run a command through the shell.

The argument is a single string that is passed verbatim to `sh`.
You can use shell variables, pipelines, `~` expansion, and everything else as expected.

```kdl
binds {
    // Works with spawn-sh: all arguments in the same string.
    Mod+D { spawn-sh "alacritty -e /usr/bin/fish"; }

    // Works with spawn-sh: shell variable ($MAIN_OUTPUT), ~ expansion.
    Mod+Return { spawn-sh "grim -o $MAIN_OUTPUT ~/screenshot.png"; }

    // Works with spawn-sh: process substitution.
    Mod+Q { spawn-sh "notify-send clipboard \"$(wl-paste)\""; }

    // Works with spawn-sh: multiple commands.
    Super+Alt+S { spawn-sh "pkill orca || exec orca"; }
}
```

`spawn-sh "some command"` is equivalent to `spawn "sh" "-c" "some command"`—it's just a less confusing shorthand.
Keep in mind that going through the shell incurs a tiny performance penalty compared to directly `spawn`ing some binary.

Using `sh` is hardcoded, consistent with other compositors.
If you want a different shell, write it out using `spawn`, e.g. `spawn "fish" "-c" "some fish command"`.

#### `quit`

Exit tiri after showing a confirmation dialog to avoid accidentally triggering it.

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Shift+E { quit; }
}
```

If you want to skip the confirmation dialog, set the flag like so:

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Shift+E { quit skip-confirmation=true; }
}
```

#### `do-screen-transition`

<sup>Upstream niri: 0.1.6</sup>

Freeze the screen for a brief moment then crossfade to the new contents.

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Return { do-screen-transition; }
}
```

This action is mainly useful to trigger from scripts changing the system theme or style (between light and dark for example).
It makes transitions like this, where windows change their style one by one, look smooth and synchronized.

For example, using the GNOME color scheme setting:

```shell
tiri msg action do-screen-transition
dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/interface/color-scheme "\"prefer-dark\""
```

By default, the screen is frozen for 250 ms to give windows time to redraw, before the crossfade.
You can set this delay like this:

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Return { do-screen-transition delay-ms=100; }
}
```

Or, in scripts:

```shell
tiri msg action do-screen-transition --delay-ms 100
```

#### `toggle-window-rule-opacity`

<sup>Upstream niri: 25.02</sup>

Toggle the opacity window rule of the focused window.
This only has an effect if the window's opacity window rule is already set to semitransparent.

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+O { toggle-window-rule-opacity; }
}
```

#### `screenshot`, `screenshot-screen`, `screenshot-window`

Actions for taking screenshots.

- `screenshot`: opens the built-in interactive screenshot UI.
- `screenshot-screen`, `screenshot-window`: takes a screenshot of the focused screen or window respectively.

The screenshot is both stored to the clipboard and saved to disk, according to the [`screenshot-path` option](./Configuration:-Miscellaneous.md#screenshot-path).

<sup>Upstream niri: 25.02</sup> You can disable saving to disk for a specific bind with the `write-to-disk=false` property:

```kdl
binds {
    Ctrl+Print { screenshot-screen write-to-disk=false; }
    Alt+Print { screenshot-window write-to-disk=false; }
}
```

In the interactive screenshot UI, pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>C</kbd> will copy the screenshot to the clipboard without writing it to disk.

<sup>Upstream niri: 25.05</sup> You can hide the mouse pointer in screenshots with the `show-pointer=false` property:

```kdl
binds {
    // The pointer will be hidden by default
    // (you can still show it by pressing P).
    Print { screenshot show-pointer=false; }

    // The pointer will be hidden on the screenshot.
    Ctrl+Print { screenshot-screen show-pointer=false; }
}
```

<sup>Upstream niri: next release</sup> You can show the mouse pointer on window screenshots with the `show-pointer=true` property.
The pointer will be included only if the window is currently receiving pointer input (usually this means the pointer is on top of the window).

```kdl
binds {
    // The pointer will be visible on the screenshot
    // if it's on top of the window.
    Alt+Print { screenshot-window show-pointer=true; }
}
```

#### `toggle-keyboard-shortcuts-inhibit`

<sup>Upstream niri: 25.02</sup>

Applications such as remote-desktop clients and software KVM switches may request that tiri stops processing its keyboard shortcuts so that they may, for example, forward the key presses as-is to a remote machine.
`toggle-keyboard-shortcuts-inhibit` is an escape hatch that toggles the inhibitor.
It's a good idea to bind it, so a buggy application can't hold your session hostage.

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Escape { toggle-keyboard-shortcuts-inhibit; }
}
```

You can also make certain binds ignore inhibiting with the `allow-inhibiting=false` property.
They will always be handled by tiri and never passed to the window.

```kdl
binds {
    // This bind will always work, even when using a virtual machine.
    Super+Alt+L allow-inhibiting=false { spawn "swaylock"; }
}
```
